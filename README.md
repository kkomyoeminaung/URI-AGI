# URI-AGI
A Unified Framework integrating Pattana-Relational Dynamics (PRD) with SU(5) Lie Algebra for Causal AGI and Black Hole Physics.

# URI-AGI: Unified Relational Intelligence

URI-AGI is a groundbreaking framework that bridges ancient causal philosophy (**Pattana**) with modern theoretical physics and **Artificial General Intelligence**. 

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Mathematical Foundation:** Uses 24 trace-free Hermitian generators of $SU(5)$ to model causal relations (*Paccaya*).
- **Physics Integration:** Predicts a relational deviation constant ($\alpha \approx 1.274$) in Hawking temperature for Kerr black holes.
- **Causal AGI:** Implements reasoning nodes based on relational links rather than mere statistical correlation.
- **Interactive Simulation:** Includes a Multi-Agent Society simulation with 3D PCA visualization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **UI:** Streamlit
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📖 Scientific Abstract
URI proposes that dynamic relations form the ontological foundation of reality. By mapping the 24 fundamental causal conditions onto $SU(5)$ generators, we construct a unified framework linking black hole thermodynamics and AGI causal reasoning.
